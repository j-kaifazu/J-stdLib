## Introduce  
This is a C++ library which was created after having Ce Jin's class.  
This library is designed to help Chinese Oier's clarify programming ideas and get IOI gold medals.
## How to use  
We define the```jppstdluoji.hpp```，If you want to refer to this library, 
you only need to copy and paste all the code into the header file 
and namespace of your program before the main function.  
Of course, you can also choose to compile your own program using our compilation AIDS (not yet done).
